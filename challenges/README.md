## Day 1:

In this kata, you will write a function that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.

For example, the array `arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0]` has a peak at position 3 with a value of 5 (since `arr[3]` equals 5).

The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks. Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}.

Example: `pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])` should return `{pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty), so you won't need to validate the input.

The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).

Also, beware of plateaus !!! `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` has a peak while `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` does not. In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position and value of the beginning of the plateau. For example: `pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])` returns `{pos: [1], peaks: [2]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

Have fun!

## Day 2:

You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

---

## Day 3:

Sudoku Checker â€“ Write a function that checks to see if a sudoku board has or has not been correctly filled out.

---

## Day 4:

We need to sum big numbers and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

Example
`add("123", "321"); -> "444"`
`add("11", "99"); -> "110"`
Notes: 
The input numbers are big.
The input is a string of only digits
The numbers are positives

---

## Day 5
- Write a method that compares nesting structures between arrays. 
- Return `true` if both arrays have the same nesting structure, and `false` if they do not

---

## Day 6
Write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

- At least six characters long
- contains a lowercase letter
- contains an uppercase letter
- contains a number

Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.

---

## Day 7
Write a function that will simplify map directions. Given an array containing values `NORTH`,`SOUTH`,`EAST`, & `WEST`, return an array where all opposite *adjacent* values are removed. Be sure that once adjacent values are removed, the array is then checked once again for *newly adjacent values*.

```
Example:
    dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"])
    output: ["WEST"]
    dirReduc(["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"])
    output: ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"]
    dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "EAST", "WEST"])
    output([])
```

---
## Day 8:

```
In mathematics, the factorial of integer n is written as n!. It is equal to the product of n and every integer preceding it. For example: 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120

Your mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer n and returns the value of n!.

You are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the non-negative range, return null, nil or None (return an empty string "" in C and C++). For non-negative numbers a full length number is expected for example, return 25! = "15511210043330985984000000" as a string.
```

## Day 9;
Consider a sequence u where u is defined as follows:

The number u(0) = 1 is the first one in u.
For each x in u, then y = 2 * x + 1 and z = 3 * x + 1 must be in u too.
There are no other numbers in u.
Ex: u = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 27, ...]

1 gives 3 and 4, then 3 gives 7 and 10, 4 gives 9 and 13, then 7 gives 15 and 22 and so on...

Task:
Given parameter n the function dbl_linear (or dblLinear...) returns the element u(n) of the ordered (with <) sequence u (so, there are no duplicates).

Example:
dbl_linear(10) should return 22

Note:
Focus attention on efficiency
