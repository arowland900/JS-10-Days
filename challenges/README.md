## Day 1:

In this kata, you will write a function that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.

For example, the array `arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0]` has a peak at position 3 with a value of 5 (since `arr[3]` equals 5).

The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks. Both of these properties should be arrays. If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}.

Example: `pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])` should return `{pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty), so you won't need to validate the input.

The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).

Also, beware of plateaus !!! `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` has a peak while `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` does not. In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position and value of the beginning of the plateau. For example: `pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])` returns `{pos: [1], peaks: [2]}` (or equivalent in other languages)

Have fun!

## Day 2:

You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

## Day 3:

Sudoku Checker â€“ Write a function that checks to see if a sudoku board has or has not been correctly filled out.

---

## Day 4:

We need to sum big numbers and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

Example
`add("123", "321"); -> "444"`
`add("11", "99"); -> "110"`
Notes: 
The input numbers are big.
The input is a string of only digits
The numbers are positives

## Day 5
- Write a method that compares nesting structures between arrays. 
- Return `true` if both arrays have the same nesting structure, and `false` if they do not
---

## Day 6
Write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

- At least six characters long
- contains a lowercase letter
- contains an uppercase letter
- contains a number

Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.
